This project is a fork of the default [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) that [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) uses, aiming to add enough functionality to make minima a realistic choice, without any bloat / nonsense.

## About 

minimaJake is used to host [JakeSteam](https://github.com/JakeSteam)'s [personal](https://jakelee.co.uk), [programming](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk), and [internet history](https://history.jakelee.co.uk) sites.

This is the live demo, a full guide to all features is available in [the announcement post](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/introducing-minimajake-for-jekyll/).
