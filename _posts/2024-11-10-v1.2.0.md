Various UI & metadata improvements, plus changes to some defaults for simpler front matter (hence the minor version bump).

Full list of changes:

- Added default post type as `post`, to avoid specifying in every article.
- Added support for specifying an author name & URL in `_config.yml`, to be used as a default if a post has no author. This also removes the requirement to specify a post's author.
- Makes Table of Contents full-width on smaller devices, to avoid unreadable surround text (see images below).
- Fixes top corners of banner images on homepage overlapping rounded background (see images below).
- Fixes slight overlap of each site picker site, especially visible on smaller devices.
