This release adds a big new feature: Calendars!

Using the [original basic (and Russian) code](https://mikhail-yudin.ru/blog/frontend/jekyll-calendar-css-grid) for dynamically displaying a month's days and signifying some have events, a complex calendar is now possible.

To add to a site using `minimaJake`, just include this on any page ([example](https://github.com/JakeSteam/minimaJake/blob/main/calendar.md)):

{% raw %}

```
{% include custom/calendar.md %}
```

{% endraw %}

There is [a live example](/calendar/) on this site with sample data, give it a look! Intended for [my internet history site](https://history.jakelee.co.uk), the key features are:

### Dark mode & responsive support

It looks pretty good in both light and dark mode, with the number of columns responding to screen width, and the clickable days using the site's accent colour:

|                               Dark                                |                                Light                                |                                Mobile                                 |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| [![](/images/v1_1_0_dark-thumbnail.png)](/images/v1_1_0_dark.png) | [![](/images/v1_1_0_light-thumbnail.png)](/images/v1_1_0_light.png) | [![](/images/v1_1_0_mobile-thumbnail.png)](/images/v1_1_0_mobile.png) |

I'll likely tidy up the code & UI a bit eventually, but it's definitely good enough for now!

### Automatically populated

Using a `dates` array defined in any post's front matter, events are collated and used to populate an `events` string that is attached to the day's `data-events` field.

The `dates` format is intentionally simple, so that it can be extended with additional metadata if required. For now, just a date and title is enough.

```yml
dates:
  - { date: "2024-01-01", title: "First Jan event" }
  - { date: "2018-04-08", title: "An event from April 2018" }
  - {
      date: "2020-08-19",
      title: "August event with a long name that goes on and on",
    }
  - { date: "2024-10-08", title: "Calendars released in minimaJake v1.1.0!" }
```

### Info dialog

Firstly, the "years ago" is calculated based on the stated date. Then, the event's information is displayed along with a link to the original post.

This uses an HTML dialog, meaning almost no JavaScript is required. All that's needed is setting a click event on each event day, that sets the dialog's contents and makes it visible. That's it!

```js
eventDays.forEach((day) => {
  day.addEventListener("click", function () {
    eventContent.innerHTML =
      "<h3>On this day:</h3>" + this.getAttribute("data-events");
    dialog.showModal();
  });
});
```

Even the close button uses plain old HTML, thanks to a neat feature of `dialog`s:

```html
<dialog id="eventDialog">
  <p id="eventContent"></p>
  <form method="dialog">
    <button autofocus>Close</button>
  </form>
</dialog>
```

I'll likely do a longer write-up on [my programming blog](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk) once it's properly released, let me know if you want any extra features!
