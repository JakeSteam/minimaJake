This update primarily replaces the search technology for a much speedier & easier to customise one! You can read [more about this change](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/using-simplejekyllsearch-for-easy-and-quick-site-search/) on my programming blog.

## Changes
* Replaces lunr.js search with [SimpleJekyllSearch](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search/)
* Redesigns search page to use same CSS as homepage to provide a more seamless experience (and require no custom CSS from including page)
