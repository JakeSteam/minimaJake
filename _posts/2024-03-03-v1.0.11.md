Adds ability to override maximum depth of headers shown in table of contents. The default is 4, this post uses 3 by setting `maxheader: 3` in the post's front matter.

Additionally, a horizontal row is now at the bottom of all posts before the comments / ko-fi link, and H1s within a post are correctly indented.
