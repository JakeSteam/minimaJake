This release adds an "outdated content warning" for older content, with basic customisation. [Older release notes](/v1.0.2/) will display it!

|                       Years ago                       |                      Days ago                       |

By default, no warning is shown on any posts, however adding this to `_config.yml` will enable it:

{% raw %}
```
outdated_content_warning:
  warning_text: "⚠️ This article was last updated <b>TIME_AGO</b> and may be outdated."
  placeholder_text: "TIME_AGO"
  warning_threshold_days: 365
  ignore_date_updated: false
```
{% endraw %}

Each field should be simple enough:

- `warning_text` & `placeholder_text` determine the text to be displayed, and where the days / years ago text should go. The replacement text is dynamic to prevent any accidental collisions when string replacing.
- `warning_threshold_days` determines the minimum number of days old a post should be before showing the warning.
- `ignore_date_updated` forces the alert to only consider the *publish date* is outdated, instead of the default behaviour of considering modified date (if set).

Additionally, any article can set `hide_content_warning` to `true` to force the banner to be hidden even on outdated posts.
