Small update to change the favicon across all sites from the arbitrary little face I've been using since 2016:

![](/images/old-favicon.png)

To a proper set of defined favicons of different sizes, for now just using a photo of myself. Eventually this might end up being something more interesting, but not now!

These favicon assets and configs are stored in [`/assets/image/icon/`](https://github.com/JakeSteam/minimaJake/tree/main/assets/images/icon) and defined in `head.html`. I generated them using a super simple [online tool](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
