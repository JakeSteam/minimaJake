After a recent post having a *lot* of headings and being almost unusable on mobile, I realised the table of contents should be collapsible!

This uses the amazing `<details>` element and worked straight away, all it needed was a bit of CSS tidying to line things up.

The feature is enabled by default, and can be disabled with `table_of_contents_collapsible: false` in `_config.yml`.

Here's how they look expanded and shrunk, I've also added some example headers to this post to try it yourself:

[![](/images/v1_0_9_default.png)](/images/v1_0_9_default.png)[![](/images/v1_0_9_collapsed.png)](/images/v1_0_9_collapsed.png)  

## Header 1

### Header 2

### Header 3

## Header 4

## Header 5

### Header 6

#### Header 7

#### Header 8

## Header 9
