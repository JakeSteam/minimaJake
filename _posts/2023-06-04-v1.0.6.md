Tiny hotfix to resolve search results sometimes failing to load.

This was caused by the `search` function being called immediately on load, which would often be before the post data had actually been loaded. This only occurred intermittently, hence why it wasn't detected earlier!

Google Search Console alerted me to a "Soft 404", as clicking tags on posts would sometimes look like no results were available. Google would then interpret this as a user-friendly 404, which... it kinda was.
