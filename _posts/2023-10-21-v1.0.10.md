A few tiny improvements that might as well get released! Support for x.com links, cache-busting, and disabling a few built-in features (stripping HTML from excerpts & forcing external links into a new tab).

* Support "x" as a social media source in site config.
* Avoid new versions of the site loading old CSS files.
* Ability to display HTML in excerpts (replace `show_excerpts` with `show_excerpts_html`)
* Ability to disable all external links opening in a new tab (`open_external_links_in_new_tab`)
