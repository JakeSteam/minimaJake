This update adds a "network site" picker, and adds missing functionality to the search feature.

## Changes
* Adds "network site" bar at the top of the page, controlled by config
* Improves search functionality:
  * Sorts results according to relevance (tags > title > excerpt > url / date / content)
  * Highlight search term within results (colour needs improving?)
  * Exclude single-character search
  * Display number of results 

## Fixes
* Stops search looking inside character codes (e.g. `&amp;`)
* Stops version number string going onto multiple lines
