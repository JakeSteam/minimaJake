This release fixes various minor syntactical errors in the generated HTML, and improves header behaviour on mobile devices.

## Errors

Previously there were various errors around HTML elements that didn't do anything useful, lots of pointless whitespace in the source code, and just general clutter.

## Self-closing tags

Having self-closing tags clutters up HTML 5 validators with lowest level warnings, so removing them is preferred. Unfortunately this isn't built-in, so [had to be done manually](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/issues/486#issuecomment-1705352779).

## Headers on mobile

Previously tapping an icon to navigate directly to a header was essentially impossible on mobile. This could have been fixed by increasing the text inset on small devices, but just moving it to the end seemed more sensible.

## Bumps Ruby & anchor headings versions

Ruby version required for [CI to pass](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/670), anchor headings didn't add anything new.
