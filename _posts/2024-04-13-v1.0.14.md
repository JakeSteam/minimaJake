As always, just a few little fixes, mostly CSS tidying for quoted lists, and behaviour when no specific version of the theme is set.

For example, this list:

> 1. Hello
> 2. This
> 3. Is
> 4. Numbered

Is rendered as:

|             Old              |             New              |
| :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| ![](/images/v1_0_14_old.png) | ![](/images/v1_0_14_new.png) |
