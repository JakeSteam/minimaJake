Small update to better support [my fiction site](https://fiction.jakelee.co.uk), with better block quote indenting and the ability to display an article's word count instead of read time.

Setting `replace_read_time_with_word_count` to `true` in `_config.yml` will replace read time (e.g. "5 mins") with word count (e.g. "1.3k words") in the article list.
